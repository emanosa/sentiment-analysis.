# Sentiment-analysis
# The primary goal of a sentiment analysis project is to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in text data ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18272c23-5b9d-4e70-b63c-84045b028965)
- Goal: Predict the sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) from text data.
- Use Cases: Customer reviews, social media posts, product feedback, etc.
- Sentiment Distribution: Check for class imbalances (e.g., more positive reviews than negative).
- Word Clouds: Create word clouds for each sentiment category to visualize common words.
- Text Embeddings: Convert text into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF.
- Classical Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM for a quick baseline
